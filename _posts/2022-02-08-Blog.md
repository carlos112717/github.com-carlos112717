title: Hard Link

In Linux, each of the files is represented by an inode, a kind of unique serial code that contains all the information about the data that can be found in that file.

A hard link is nothing more than a label or a new name associated with an inode. It is a way of identifying the same content with different names. This link is not a separate copy of the above file but a different name for exactly the same content.

To create a hard link in Linux from the file file.txt to new_name.txt, we execute:

$ ln file.txt new_name.txt

The link will appear as just another file in the directory and will point to the same content as the .txt file. Any changes made will be reflected in the same way for both file.txt and new_name.txt.

A link can be deleted using the rm command in the same way a file is deleted, however the content will not be deleted as long as there is a hard link still referencing it. This can have several benefits, but it can also make tracking your files more difficult. A hard link also cannot be used to refer to directories or files on other computers.


title: Symbolic Links


A symbolic link can also be defined as a label or a new name associated with a file but unlike hard links, the symbolic link does not contain the file data, it simply points to the file system record where the data is located. It is very similar to a shortcut in Windows or an alias in OS X.

To create a symbolic link from the file file.txt to new_name.txt, we execute: ln -s <SoftLink name> <Directory which soft link will point to> $ ln -s file.txt new_name.txt

Example: ln -s latest 1.0

So here is pointing the latest soft link to the 1.0 directory

This link will also appear as just another file in the directory and will point to the same content as file.txt, reflecting all changes made to both file.txt and new_name.txt.

On a symbolic link you can also use all the basic file commands (rm, mv, cp, etc). however when the original file is deleted or moved to a different location the link will stop working and the link is said to be broken.

A symbolic link allows you to link directories and, using NFS, also allows you to link files outside of your computer. At first it may seem complicated, but after reading in detail, you will surely have a clearer idea of ​​when to use a symbolic link and when to use a physical one.

To update a symbolic link ln -nsf <New directory> <Soft link>

Example: Suppose you want to point the last soft link now to the new 1.1 directory, then you will run the following command:

ln -nsf 1.1 latest
