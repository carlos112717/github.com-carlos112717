### Hard Links


In Linux, each of the files is represented by an inode, a kind of unique serial code that contains all the information about the data that can be found in that file.

A hard link is nothing more than a label or a new name associated with an inode. It is a way of identifying the same content with different names. This link is not a separate copy of the above file but a different name for exactly the same content.

To create a hard link in Linux from the file file.txt to new_name.txt, we execute:
''' linux
$ ln file.txt new_name.txt
'''
The link will appear as just another file in the directory and will point to the same content as the .txt file. Any changes made will be reflected in the same way for both file.txt and new_name.txt.

A link can be deleted using the rm command in the same way a file is deleted, however the content will not be deleted as long as there is a hard link still referencing it. This can have several benefits, but it can also make tracking your files more difficult. A hard link also cannot be used to refer to directories or files on other computers.


### Symbolic Links

Symbolic links also called (symlink), are files in Linux that are chained or point to another file that is in a different place within the directory structure.

Modifications made with symlink will be reflected in the original file

The graphic illustrates the creation of a file using the echo command, then the creation of a permanent link, and then a symbolic link. Modifying the original file name does not affect the permanent link but the symbolic link is broken.

### Difference between a soft link and a hard link

Soft Links are similar to shortcuts, they can point to another file or directory on any file system.

Hard links are also shortcuts for files and folders, but you cannot create a hard link for a folder or file on a different file system.
